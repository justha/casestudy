    <h2>Making Sense of Our Money System</h2>
    <p>Venmo is responsible for other people's money, so it is crucial that people understand how
        money operates within the Venmo ecosystem. Venmo is comprised of three different payment
        methods: bank accounts, debit/credit cards and Venmo balances. Depending on the scenario,
        there are different rules that apply to how money movement works. At a high level, money
        moves instantly on Venmo and transactions are free, unless you use a credit card or a debit
        card from a smaller bank.</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>There are many nuances with Venmo’s payment methods relating to fees, timing, transferring
        to banks and type of payments (i.e. paying people or paying merchants). Our most frequent
        support cases come from issues related to our money system. In order to properly scope this
        project and not try to tackle a bunch of problems at once, we decided to focus on one task:
        <strong><em>make it easier to send and receive money on Venmo by simplifying the way one adds and
        manages banks and cards.</strong></em></p>
    <P>Below are screens that were being used when we started this project.</P>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>We used an adaptation of Google Ventures <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-understand-day-1-e164f76e69cf#.7qju80cms" target="_blank" >product design sprint</a>. This included phases for
        understanding the problem, diverging on solutions, deciding on solutions, prototyping and user
        testing. The project team consisted of an engineer, product manager and product designer. This
        was an accelerated project with the majority of the work completed within two weeks. There
        was a huge time constraint to ship the project because it directly affected another significant
        project that already had a firm deadline to ship.</p>
        
        <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <p>After we were confident that everyone on the project team fully understood the problem that
            we were trying to solve, we created a user story (created based on our research and
            knowledge) that would guide the project. Then we moved on to Phase 2, “Exploration”. Phase 2
            of the sprint began with a lot of white boarding and sketching. We aimed to generate as many
            ideas as possible, while keeping in mind the constraints that we defined during Phase 1.
            Below are sketches of ideas that came out during one session of Phase 2. Our sketches were
            very rough; it was really about brainstorming and not getting attached to a single idea.</p>
    <img src="assets/exploration.JPG" alt="">
    <p>We took all of the ideas generated during Phase 2 and had mini-critiques on each of them.
        During Phase 3, we decided on which ideas to move forward with (i.e. prototype and user test)
        and which ones to discard.</p>
        
        <h3>Prototyping and User Testing</h3>
        <p>We are big proponents of making quick prototypes and getting it in front of people so that we
            can validate/test our ideas. For this project, I used a combination of Pixate and Invision to
            prototype full flows of our concepts and interactions. Building quick prototypes allowed us to
            get a better idea of how confident we were with a given solution.</p>
            <p>Below is an example of a prototype that we used during a user testing session. The user tests
                helped us identify three things: what we’re confident works, what we’re somewhat confident
                works and what we’re unsure of. Identifying “confidence levels” allowed us to recognize what
                needed more work.</p>
    <img src="assets/prototype+1.png" alt="">
    <p>After a round of testing, we found that people were having the most trouble understanding (i)
        the difference between a bank account and a card, and (ii) how Venmo balance works. In order
        to solve (i), we did more research and developed a ranking of what people tended to look for
        when identifying a card visually:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Color and appearance of card <i>(Diagonal blue gradient)</i></span></li>
            <li><span>Product brand/name <i>(Chase Sapphire Preferred)</i></span></li>
            <li><span>Type of card <i>(Debit)</i></span></li>
            <li><span>Issuing Bank <i>(Chase)</i></span></li>
            <li><span>Network <i>(Visa)</i></span></li>
            <li><span>Last 4 <i>(••1234)</i></span></li>
        </ol>
    <p>See below for an example of how we iterated on the visuals of this concept to help people
        understand the difference between a bank account and a card. <em>(I understand that the 2nd
        iteration doesn't completely follow the ranked list above. This decision was made because of
        constraints at that time. This will be improved during a later phase of this project.)</em></p>
    <img src="assets/iterations.png" alt="">
    <p>The 2nd iteration worked a lot better because the card was shaped like a card, and the bank
        was not. Also, people immediately saw the word “Debit” or “Credit” on the card image, and
        that helped people correctly associate the image with a card instead of a bank.</p>
        
    <h3>Building It</h3>
    <p>A dozen prototypes later, we finally had something that we felt confident about. At this point, it
        was time to polish UI elements and layouts. Also, because of the time constraint, we had to
        make some tradeoffs in order to hit the deadline. This meant making hard decisions to define
        what was required for the MVP.</p>
    <p>Below is what shipped as the MVP.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>A byproduct of a project such as this is the broad impact on each user’s core experience with
        Venmo. We’re able to take what worked well, and what didn’t work so well, and apply it to
        future projects. We’ve also uncovered a lot of useful insights about people’s behaviors that we
        weren’t aware of previously. Here are a couple things that stood out to me during this project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When trying to explain a very complex system, it is worthwhile to think about simplifying the
            system, if at all possible and backed up with reason, rather than trying to explain all the
            nuances of such a system. Removing pieces of a system might rock the boat initially, but in the
            end, simplifying the model might cost less time and effort.</li>
        <li>People like to focus on the task at hand. Anything not related to the task is secondary and tends
            to be ignored. If my task is to <i>“add a credit card to Venmo to use for future payments”</i>, I’m
            going to have tunnel vision until that task is completed. For example, if I see copy trying to
            explain a concept to me while I’m trying to complete a task, I’ll skim over it because it’s
            secondary to the task at hand.</li>
        <li>Security (perception and actual) <em>always matters</em>, no matter what the task is.</li>
    </ul>
